# TWRP (Custom Recovery)

> [!NOTE]
> Not tested yet, we need to unlock the bootloader to boot TWRP

When trying to flash via flash tool / mtkclient it gives Red State error and goes into bootloop. There is access during this error only to fastboot, recovery and normal mode is not available.

**Looks like we need to unlock the bootloader to test this.**
