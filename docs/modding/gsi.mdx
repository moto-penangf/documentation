## What is GSI?
GSI (Generic System Image) is a universal Android image created by Google as part of Project Treble. It is designed to work on any compatible device, providing a clean AOSP experience without manufacturer modifications.

Custom GSI refers to modified versions of GSI (e.g., LineageOS, Pixel Experience, CrDroid) developed by third-party developers. They allow users to upgrade their devices, experience a stock Android environment without bloatware, and unlock additional customization options.
