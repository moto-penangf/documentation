**MOTOROLA SHITTY FIRMWARE WARNING**

Motorola really has shitty firmware.
Carefully read all the warnings in the documentation, and if something doesnâ€™t work - **DO NOT CONTINUE, THERE IS A RISK OF BRICKING YOUR DEVICE!**
**Don't cry later and don't say we didn't warn you...**
:::

This documentation is dedicated to discoveries made by me and other people interested in unlocking the Moto G23 and Moto G13 bootloader.
